# Horiseon Homepage

## Description

Horiseon provides three products: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. This repository contains the HTML and CSS of the homepage. 

This homework assignment consisted of refactoring the HTML to become semantic. Therefore, I edited the HTML and CSS selectors to enable proper styling. I also added 'alt' attributes to images for accessibility purposes. I learned the importance of committing frequently and how to undo all changes made to a file in VS Code.  

## Usage

Navigate to [Horiseon](https://nicklearning.github.io/horiseon-marketing-website/) to visit the Horiseon homepage.

Here is a screenshot of the homepage:
