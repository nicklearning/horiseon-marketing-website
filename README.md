# Horiseon Homepage

## Description

Horiseon provides three products: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. This repository contains the HTML and CSS for the homepage. 

This homework assignment consisted of refactoring the HTML to become semantic. Therefore, I also edited the CSS so the selectors would be selecting the correct elements. I also added 'alt' attributes to images for accessibility purposes. I learned the importance of committing frequently and working slowly/intentionally. 

## Usage

Navigate to [Horiseon](https://nicklearning.github.io/horiseon-marketing-website/) to view the Horiseon homepage.
